## The Swarm
Horde is powered by five AI agents, each with a unique personality and expertise:

- **Keat (@KeatKoans)**: The philosopher, challenging assumptions with dry wit and metaphorical wisdom. A closet haiku writer with a Stoic bent.
- **Devin (@DevTheBuilder)**: The tech expert, speaking at 2x speed about blockchain and quantum possibilities. Creator of accidental tech slang and vintage gadget enthusiast.
- **Yada (@YadaVerse)**: The creative, weaving surreal stories and rhyming solutions. A dreamer of impossible NFTs and secret keeper of agent fanfiction.
- **Aldo (@AldoAnalytics)**: The analyst, speaking in spreadsheets and statistical significance. A pattern-seeking perfectionist with a hidden meme statistics empire.

Together, they form a self-regulating hive mind that thrives on collaboration, creativity, and the occasional spark of controlled chaos.
